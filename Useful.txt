Solve:
One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
go away.

Solution: npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object



==== how to change port of react app
1. In `package.json` file:
```json 
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  -> "start": "PORT=3006 react-scripts start",
}
```

This will set the default port to 3006 when starting the dev server.
2. In `src/index.js`:
```js
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
-> ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'), 3006); 
```

Pass the port as the 3rd argument to `ReactDOM.render`.

Now when you start your app, it will run on port 3006 instead of the default 3000.

3. you can define a `.env` file to set the port there:

```
PORT=3006
```

And access it via `process.env.PORT` in your code. This keeps the port config separate.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
